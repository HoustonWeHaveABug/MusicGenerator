# MusicGenerator

This program is a solution to challenge https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7ifbd5/20171208_challenge_343_hard_procedural_music/.

It allows random generation of music driven by initial settings read on standard input. The program can generate one or more pieces with a chords line and a melody line. The chords generated will determine the corresponding notes that may be played by the melody.

The input must follow the below structure:

2                     # Number of pieces generated

-- Piece 1 settings
2                     -- Tonic note (0 = C, 1 = C#, ..., 11 = B)                        
0                     -- Minor flag (0/1)
16                    -- Number of bars
4                     -- Bar size
320                   -- Bar duration
20 20 20 20 20 20 0   -- 5th chord frequencies (example means that a chord has 20/120 chances to be in position I to VI and 0/120 to be in position VII)
0 10 10 0 10 10 0     -- 7th chord frequencies

-- Chords line settings
0                     -- Depth (number of times a beat can be splitted in <bar size> parts)
10 60                 -- Beat split fraction (example means that a beat has 10/70 chances to be splitted and 60/70 to stay at the current depth)
30 60                 -- Beat merge fraction (only possible if previous beat is at the same depth)
0 10 20 30            -- 5th chord richness frequencies (example means that a set has 30/60 chances to be composed of 3 notes, 20/60 to be composed of 2 notes, ...)
0 10 20 30 40         -- 7th chord richness frequencies
30 59                 -- Minimum/Maximum pitches (0 to 127)
30 20                 -- Pitch reference change fraction

-- Melody line settings (same structure as chords line)
1                     -- Depth must be greater than or equal to chords line depth
10 60
30 60
0 30 20 10
0 40 30 20 10
60 89                 -- Minimum/Maximum pitches must not overlap those of chords line
30 20

-- Piece 2 settings
...

-- Index of pieces generated in output (0-based)
0
1
0

The output generated has the below structure (1 line per note played):

...
81 48.80 0.80         -- Pitch/Start/Duration (start and duration are divided by 100)
73 49.60 0.80
74 50.40 0.40
78 50.40 0.40
74 50.80 0.20
83 50.80 0.20
...
